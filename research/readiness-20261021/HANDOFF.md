# Local preparation handoff

The preparation work is committed locally on `readiness-next6-20261021`. Read
[README.md](README.md) for results and commands and [REVIEW.md](REVIEW.md) for
outstanding questions. The unfilled review receipt is intentional. No reviewer
consent, external posting, or public donor intake is asserted.

Run `python research/readiness-20261021/check_manifest.py` from the repository root
to verify the prepared source/artifact bindings before review. `first-steps.json`
records all catalogue entry-command checks in the documented environments.
